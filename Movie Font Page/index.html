                        biggest heist in recorded history -- to print billions of euros in the Royal Mint of Spain. To
                        help him carry out the ambitious plan, he recruits eight people with certain abilities and who
                        have nothing to lose. The group of thieves take hostages to aid in their negotiations with the
                        authorities, who strategize to come up with a way to capture The Professor. As more time

                        starting in 1919, several months after the end of the First World War. It centres on the Peaky
                        Blinders street gang and their ambitious, cunning crime boss Tommy Shelby (Murphy).What does
                        Thomas Shelby say? Why do the Shelby's say In the Bleak Midwinter? The quote “In the Bleak
                        Midwinter” was first used when Tommy (played by Cillian Murphy) 'killed' Danny (Samuel
                        Edward-Cook) in season one. Tommy then also mumbled the term when he thought he was going to be
                        shot at the end of season two</p>

                        <p>Based on characters created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg, this series follows Lucifer, the original fallen angel, who has become dissatisfied with his life in hell. After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifer's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul.
